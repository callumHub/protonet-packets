# Replication and Extension of 
### Extensible Machine Learning for Encrypted Network Traffic Application Labeling via Uncertainty Quantification
By Jorgensen et al. 

### Description of repository progression
  * Started with Jake Snells Prototypical Network Repository
  * Adapted from CNN with image data to MLP with tabular data
  * Further adapted to include uncertainty quantification algorithms described in Jorgensen et al.
  * Found OOD detection is not that great
  * Used bias-diminishing from the FSL algorithm: BDCSPN during training only
  * This improves OOD detection somewhat. BDCSPN alone is still better but a transductive method
