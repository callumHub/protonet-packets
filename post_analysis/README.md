### Purpose:
Separate directory for analysis of model behaviour

This directory will be entirely decoupled from the rest of the codebase.

#### Purpose 1: Testing similar algorithms on the same data
We want to test different algorithms to determine the impact of each stage in protonet OOD classification. 


#### Purpose 2:
Using the encoder to embed the features, and then visualize the embeddings, 
while comparing the embeddings to the original feature visualization
